Relational operators help you compare two values or variables. They give you a result of either True or False based on the comparison.

Basic Comparison
Let's start with a simple example:

height1 = 12
height2 = 14
print(height1 < height2) # Outputs True because 12 is less than 14

#In this example, the `<` operator compares `height1` and `height2`. Since `height1` is less than `height2`, it returns `True`.
Other Relational Operators
Here are some more examples of relational operators:

- a > b   (Checks if `a` is greater than `b`)
- a == b  (Checks if `a` is equal to `b`)
- a != b  (Checks if `a` is not equal to `b`)
- a >= b  (Checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`)
- a <= b  (Checks if `a` is less than or equal to `b`)



           # solution as follows
height1 = 15
height2 = 13
print(height1 != height2) # returns True because 15 is not equal to 13
